# Text Similarity Model
Text Similarity is a statistical model that analyzes and scores the similarity of text samples to identify a particular author or style of writing. The similarity score computed is based on a statistical model known as a Naive Bayes probability model. Five features integrated in the model are: word frequencies, word-length frequencies, stem frequencies, frequencies of different sentence lengths, and punctuation frequencies. 

I chose articles from the New York Times and the Wall Street Journals as two "source" models. To compare against the sources, I chose four articles from the Boston Globe, CNN, Forbes and Fox News. Biref result can be found at reflection.txt file.
